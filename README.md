To summarize:
1. Go to the directory where the code is.
2. Initialize: git init
3. Add the files: git add *
4. Commit the files: git commit -m "<comment>"
5. Create a repository on github (if it is not already there)
6. Add this as a remote origin: git remote add origin https://github.com/whogit/MRT.git
7. Pull from that remote origin to local: git pull origin master
8. And finally, push all of my files up: git push origin master
